            According to Gregorc, I have a thinking style of 'concrete random'. A 'concrete random' learner likes to experiment using their intuition. They learn best when competing with others through trial and error approaches. They also work best when working alone. This is something I need to improve for my experience at DBC because I will be immersed in an environment filled with collaboration, trades of feedback. I need to be able to share the spontaneous (at times random) thought process with my peers. Also re-doing anything once it's done is something I struggle with, but as an aspiring world-class developer I need to be able to re-visit my work for refactoring. Showing and explaining how I came to get my answer is also hard for me. I want to practice learning to verbalize my thought process instead of just wandering around randomly. This test is very accurate as far as pointing out my strengths and weaknesses. I will stay aware of the weaknesses so I can improve them through my days at DBC.

            Up to this point in phase 0, I struggled with things that lacked specific directions. For me I do best work when given specific tasks with a set deadline. However, when given a task with open possibilities I struggled to seek guidance. Moreover, peer pairing was difficult for me, not in the sense that I had trouble collaborating with my peers. I can communicate well and work together with people with a positive attitude, but explaining my thoughts and coming to a middle ground with other people's thought process was rather difficult. I feel more comfortable working alone, doing trial and error. To fix this, I will put myself in an interactive environment more willingly.

            In conclusion, I want to expand the spectrum of my thought processing. I don't want to be confined to and fixated on absolute facts and logic. I want to be creative; I want to explore new areas I do not know much about. I believe a great developer takes risks and keeps an open mind about his surroundings. I will continue to discipline the way I think to improve myself.
