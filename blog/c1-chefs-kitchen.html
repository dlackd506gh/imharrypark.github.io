        My first time hearing about Dev Bootcamp was from a friend who had just graduated from the program. He began to tell me how intense the workload was and the demanding time commitment to learn to become a world-class beginner developer in just 19 weeks. However, he did mention this. It was a lot of fun. I research everything about Dev Bootcamp, trying to see if I would be a good fit. Because I have great yearning for coding, programming, and web development, I was instantly drawn to the immersive environment that DBC provides. Students and teachers at DBC all seemed to be committed to learn; they were genuinely eager to learn more and improve. At the same time, they seemed to be having so much fun while learning! That was impression I got from DBC.

        Since then, my impression has not changed a bit. After I was accepted into the 2015 Cohort (Yay!), I could not be more thankful to be around such passionate learners in an environment where everyone has each other's back, resources are always available, and both students and teachers actually have fun while working! It has only been 4 days since Phase 0 started, but I am enjoying every minute of it. My expectations are growing as I learn more. I hope that my cohort mates and I all work together to make this experience the best it can be. Instead of having the 'consumer mindset' where one expects to be given certain service for paying a price, I want us to approach with the 'creator mindset' where the group work hard to create our own experience for the next 19 weeks here at Dev Bootcamp.
