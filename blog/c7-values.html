        <h1>My Values</h1>
        <h2>On what I think <em>matters</em> the most</h2>

            Everyone lives with some kind of a 'value system'. It is believed that a person's every decision is ultimately based on his or her values. In other words, people live for what they believe to be the most important. Here are some of the values I find "important" and my numeric evaluation of them, ranging from <strong>1</strong> (<em>disagree</em>) through <strong>5</strong> (<em>agree</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th colspan="2"><em>Harry's Values</em></th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr><td><strong>Values</strong></td><td><strong>Evaluation</strong></td></tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Accomplishment</li>

            Out of the 9 values, I find <em>creativity</em> and <em>excitement</em> very important to me. Personally, I feel the most proud of myself when I have created something from scratch. It could be anything -- from music to a functioning code. I love the process of creation: the beginning stage where you ponder about the project, the intermediate stage during which you gather your knowledge and information to create, then the final stage of witnessing everything come into form. To me, creation is a beautiful thing. It is a way of expressing oneself to the world. This transitions into excitement. I believe that a person does the best work with the full potential when he or she is excited. Excitement for me is the fuel that gives the energy to pursue and achieve. I have had too many experiences where I struggled to accomplish something not because the task was difficult but due to lack of excitement/intrigue.

            Just yesterday, a friend of mine asked me an advice on relationship. He was not sure if he should continue dating his girlfriend because he felt as if the girl did not appreciate his effort. My friend was devastated because he was trying his best to make the relationship work, but because of his girlfriend's lack of gratitude he just slowly losing hope. I advised him that if the thought of pursuing the relationship further does not excite him or give him hope, he should end it. It was meaningless to hold onto something if he did not have the heart in it. This was related to the value I hold: a belief that there must exist some type of excitement or intrigue in order for a person to endure hardship with perseverence. Just for your information, my friend did not listen to my advice. He went and apologize to his upset girlfriend. Tsk tsk.

            These values are what make my individuality. The type of person I became is strongly dependent on the values I hold. I believe that when I ever face a hardship at Dev Bootcamp, I could remind myself what an amazing community I am immersed in and what an exciting path I am headed. The thought of one day becoming a world-class developer excites me greatly and gives me so much energy to work hard.
