            "Internet? You mean the <em>thing</em> we click to search our favorite dish recipe or look up videos of the 'Corgi Flop'?"
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Yes!</strong> We often take the amazing powers of the Internet for granted because -- let's face it -- it's been available for us without any cost! I know nobody likes a know-it-all... but allow me to show you in steps <em>how</em> the Internet really works. Wouldn't hurt, right?
          </p>
          <img src = "../imgs/internet.jpg" width = "100%">
          <p>
            <strong>Step 1.</strong><br>
            This is the part you're probably the most familiar with. It's simply when you type the desired website's url (i.e. <em>github.com</em>) into your brower.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 2.</strong><br>
            One of the key components of the Internet is called the <em>hardware</em>. It includes everything from the cables to a modem and/or router. A <em>modem</em> or a <em>router</em> allows you to travel to another network around the world. <em>Firewalls</em> in your browser act as a security guard that permits or prohibits incoming/outcoming data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 3.</strong><br>
            Now... SOMETHING's got to be storing all these information we find on the web, right? Unsurprisingly, there are machines called the <em>servers</em> that store information. When your query reaches the <em>ISP (Internet Service Provider)</em>, one of many servers called a <em>DNS Server (Domain Name Server)</em> translates the text domain name (<em>github.com</em>) into the numerically specific <em>IP address</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 4.</strong><br>
            With the identified IP address, your browser will now get ready to take you to the unique location on the <em>World Wide Web</em> using a special language called the <em>hypertext transfer protocol (http)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 5.</strong><br>
            The brower travels through the <em>cloud</em>, which consists of all the other ISPs and home/business networks. It is a network of networks, so in essence the cloud is the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 6.</strong><br>
            A successful connection between you and the desired website is established.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 7.</strong><br>
            Your brower finally brings back the data and information from the website to your computer. The rate of retrieval is usually faster than the rate of establishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            There you have it, folks. This is how the Internet works. Beautiful!
