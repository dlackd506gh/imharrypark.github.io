          <h2>block, Proc, and lambda</h2>

            Today I want to talk about blocks, Procs, and lambdas. If you have never seen them before, you're in the right place. Hopefully by the end of this reading, you'll have a much better understanding of the three terms and when to use them appropriately. Let us start with a <em>block</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So... what is a <em>block</em>?! Well, I don't mean to shock you or anything, but you've been using blocks ever since... God knows how long. Whenever we iterated through an array/hash or used #map! or #collect! to change their elements, we used blocks. A block is a code that goes in between 'do' and 'end' -- or {}. Here's are two equivalent, yet syntactically different, examples of a block:<br></br>
            <img src ="../imgs/block.png" width = "70%"><br></br>
            Blocks are incredibly useful in accessing individual elements within a collective objects like arrays and hashes, and they do this by setting variables within the pipelines. To show you what is responsible for the convenient way the blocks function, I present to you... <em>yield</em>.<br></br>
            <img src = "../imgs/yield.png" width = "70%"><br></br>
            Thanks to #yield, I can now create my own method (#iterate!) that works exactly the same as #map! or #collect!. It's always good to know how and why something works, instead of just blindedly enjoy its convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I should have mentioned is the fact that the blocks are <strong>not</strong> objects. They are just 'blocks' of code that implement the user-given information to perform a certain task. But what if you want to repeatedly use the same block? We sure don't want to write it over and over since that wouldn't be such a D.R.Y. way of coding, now is it? Here is when <em>Procs</em> -- short for <em>Procedures</em> -- come into play. Procs are in fact objects that can be stored as variables. To make it even easier for you to understand: Procs are basically your code blocks being 'stored' in a variable for repeated use! How nice of ruby. Here's an example of how to use Procs.<br></br>
            <img src ="../imgs/proc.png" width = "70%"><br></br>
            Neat, right? You can even look at it as a 'copy' and 'paste' type of deal. It literally copies the block you give to <strong>Proc.new</strong> and pastes it to the #map! method. One thing to notice is the use of an <strong>ampersand (&)</strong>: it converts the Proc into a block so the block described in the Proc object can be implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I will tell you about <em>lambdas</em>. It works almost the same way as the Proc object. Let's take a look.<br></br>
            <img src = "../imgs/lambda.png" width = "70%"><br></br>
            This seems awfully similar to Procs, no? Well, as a matter of fact, a lambda is essentially a Proc object.At this point you're probably asking yourself, "Then what's the difference between a Proc and lambda?" As I mentioned before, Procs act as a 'cut and paste' tool. Moreover, it does not look for any argument parameters. Lambdas, on the other hand, are Proc objects that search for the argument parameters.<br></br>
            <img src = "../imgs/proc_lambda.png" width = "90%">
          </p>
          <p>
            Another difference is in their way of interpreting #return. Lambdas return the value of themselves, whereas Procs return out of the block.<br></br>
            <img src = "../imgs/proc_lambda.png" width = "90%">
