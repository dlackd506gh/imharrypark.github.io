          <h1>Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h1>

              What is version control, you ask? Version control is a system that allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting or deleting one another's work. Great, huh? That's not it. What makes version control even more amazing is the fact that it saves the project status along the way, so that when something goes wrong by accident, you can always recall to the last saved checkpoint or version. These features allow efficiency and a risk-proof work environment for programmers.

              Git is simply a version control platform. It helps you keep track of your work by saving every litle modification made along the way. Once you are done revising, you can 'commit', or save, your git file to be 'pushed', or uploaded, to a GitHub repository. Still confused? Well, think of it this way. Pushing modifications to GitHub is like syncing your iTunes library to your iPhone. Whatever modification I make in my iTunes Library (i.e. add a song, delete an album, update artwork, etc.) will be synced to your iPhone WHEN YOU EXPLICITLY CLICK ON 'SYNC' BUTTON. It's the same concept. By explicitly telling command line to push your git file onto GitHub, you are syncing your local file adjustment to the remote repository, up-to-date. I will discuss more about GitHub in the next paragraph.

             GitHub is an online, open-source 'hub' for programmers to store their repositories. With permission, people can revise each other's work to either fix issues or improve coding sequences. GitHub is an ideal place to store your code because it enables the public to review your work, find mistake if any, revise and improve the current version of your code. Think of it this way. You are preparing for a special night out with your crush. You pick out the outfit using your best judgment. Then, you go up to your stylish friends and ask them for feedback. They might touch up on your look, fix the tie, and ask you to change your shoes in order to make you look nicer. Of course, this is all done with your permission granted. Collaboration calls for efficiency, precision, and synergy. GitHub is a perfect tool that provides all three.
